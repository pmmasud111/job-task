# **Project Name**

**File Uploader and Task Manager**

## **Overview**

This project is a simple file uploader and task manager application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to upload files, view uploaded file names, and manage tasks.

## **Features**

- File Uploader: Upload multiple files with a maximum size of 100MB
- File List: View uploaded file names
- Task Manager: view tasks, upload files
- Extra Feature: Add Task and Delete Task (not mentioned in original requirements)

## **Installation**

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Open the application in your web browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## **Notes**

I have implemented all the features mentioned in the task requirements to the best of my understanding. As per my understanding, the requirements only asked for file name and number, so I have only saved the file name in the application state. However, I can modify the application to save the file itself if required.

Additionally, I have implemented an extra feature to delete and add task, which was not mentioned in the original requirements.

## **Task Requirements**

As per my understanding, the task requirements were to:

- Upload files with a maximum size of 100MB
- Display uploaded file names
- Implement task management features (add, delete, view)

Please let me know if I have missed any requirements or if there are any further modifications needed.
